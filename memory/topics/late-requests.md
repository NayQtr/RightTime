# الطلبات المتأخرة / المؤجلة (late / deferred requests)

When the owner says «الطلبات المتأخرة» or «الطلبات المؤجلة» (same list, 5 Nov), list these items, with what is done and what is still open.
Claude's own open questions to the owner go here too (owner's rule of 5 Nov).

## The list [2026-11-05]

Waiting on the owner (actions):
1. Paste `qatar/db/migrations/016_venue_portal.sql` (venue portal) into BOTH Supabase projects: qatar-mvp (fvodcnqmxskgzziwuwmz) and HerZone-production (pwxxulqgdydrkowmtkia). Then Claude verifies both and promotes herzone.app.
2. Delete the OLD Gemini API key (it still answers).
3. Restrict the new Gemini key to "Generative Language API" only (Google Cloud Console → Credentials). No website/IP restriction (Supabase has no fixed IP).
4. Rotate keys regularly (Gemini, Supabase token), e.g. every 3 months.
5. Enable Gemini billing before the app is published (owner's decision of 5 Nov: "التحويل المفوتر لاحقا قبل نشر التطبيق").
6. Confirm the admin enrolment for herzone.app/admin was done (token given on 5 Nov, 24 h expiry).
7. The owner's real email for the production admin account (NMX-20).

Waiting on the owner (decisions, explained on 4 Nov):
8. Don't pin the server certificate now.
9. Should the biometric lock also protect the meetup details?
10. Block screenshots or not (recommendation: don't block).
11. A phone number with a fixed code for the Apple reviewer.
12. An admin tool to delete the account of a member who lost her number (after launch, two-person approval).

From the launch checklist (5 Nov):
12a. Backups: Supabase is on the Free plan (no automatic backups). Choose: Pro plan (automatic daily backups) or a daily
     encrypted dump by GitHub Actions (the repo is public, so the dump must be encrypted; the database connection
     string goes in as a GitHub secret by the owner, never through Claude). Then test one restore on staging.
12b. Gemini spend limit: when billing is enabled, set a budget alert and a daily request quota in Google Cloud.
12c. Real payment gateway: test cards / test mode only until launch.

Claude's open questions (waiting for the owner's answer):
13. Add a secret scan to the build gate (stop the deploy if a key appears in frontend code)? Yes/no.
13a. Backups: Supabase Pro or a daily encrypted dump by GitHub Actions? (see 12a)
13b. Cadence of the baseline checks: proposed before every production release + monthly; confirm or change.
13c. (done 5 Nov) Design proposals for the website and the app were approved and applied; see qatar/docs/design/herzone.app.md.

Still open in the plan:
14. Production code still on the old release (promotion needs the owner's approval).
15. Maestro full-journey run needs the branch merged (NMX-56).
16. Blockers NMX-22/23/24/26/28; the real payment gateway must send the cardholder name.
